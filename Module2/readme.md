Writing Code Well
So far you have learned the basic building blocks in Module 0, and have practiced to exhaustion those skills during Module 1. Hopefully at this point, you have a pretty good sense of what JavaScript contains; in terms of what we might ask you to use during the technical interview/technical admissions assessment for our Immersive program. Module 2 is going to shift gears slightly, and we are going to start focusing on software engineering principles, pair programming, readability of code, and other topics not necessarily related to just JavaScript. As you solve these problems, you will learn a few new concepts and techniques that will be useful as you continue your development career. Also contained in this module, is a list of sample solutions to the problems presented. These solutions will only represent one among many valid ways to solve each challenge, and are included to give a sample finished product. Consistently modeling your code after the style in which these solutions are presented, can help you ensure improved performance during the interview/admissions assessment. The goal is to structure your code such that it presents its functionality as coherently as possible, to anyone who might view it.
