Sample of Clean Code Structure
Notes
Although we have not discussed assert, hopefully you can carefully parse its function body and make use of it by thoroughly consulting the following example code:

// FUNCTION DEFINITION(S)
function addOne(val) {
  return val + 1;
}

// ASSERTION FUNCTION(S) TO BE USED
function assert(condition, testName) {
  if (condition) {
    console.log('passed');
  } else {
    console.log('FAILED [' + testName + ']');
  }
}

// TESTS FOR isOne
var result1 = addOne(1);
assert(result1 === 2, 'should return result of a positive input number added to 1');

var result2 = addOne(-2);
assert(result2 === 1, 'should return result of a negative input number added to 1');
Please take careful note of the spacing, indentation, and consistency of the code. Run this code in a console to get a sense of what is going on. The code starts with the function definitions, followed by any assertion functions that makes sense given the function under test. We wrap up the code with our "test suite" or "test cases", which in this case is a collection of variables (we may eventually need functions to use here), as well as calls to our assertion function, all of which together can be easily run in a console to verify that our code works as expected. For more in depth information on testing, please consult our documentation on Testing and Test Driven Development. Both of these can be found in the Reference Answers and In Depth Documentation section at end of this Module.

For nearly every challenge for the remainder of the course, you will get the most out of the situation if you follow the directions and build a robust test suite (similar to the above, as well as those described in the Testing documentation) that fully verifies that your code works as expected. When you "Run Tests" you can see a console output for each challenge. Making diligent use of this feature will improve your understanding and execution of these concepts.
